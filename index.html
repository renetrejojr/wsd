         <h4>Music</h4><br>

         <article>
            <p>An excerpt from their Myspace.com profile explains how they
            approach their musical endeavors: "For some bands, there is a core
            vision and purpose that shines through from beginning to the end.
            For others, there is an evolution of an idea, a constant
            metamorphosis whose end and scope is unknown. For Moving Mountains,
            the evolution not only encapsulates their music, but a larger
            overarching concept of what defines ‘Moving Mountains’. That isn’t
            to say that the Purchase, NY quartet have an artier than thou
            complex, but it does touch on an evolving aesthetic undercurrent
            and a belief that a band can create an experiential vision that
            goes beyond music."</p>

            <p>Their musical style is reminiscent of The Appleseed Cast.</p>

            <p>Their influences include Hammock and The Album Leaf.</p>

            <p>Moving Mountains tracks <em>“Aphelion,” “Fourth,”</em> and
            <em>“8105”</em> have been used on MTV’s College Life, 16 and
            Pregnant, and Teen Mom.</p>

            <p><em>“Aphelion”</em> has been used for a trailer for AMC’s
            television drama series Mad Men.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Formation and Pneuma (2005-2009)</em></strong></p>

            <p>Their self-released album, Pneuma, was written by Gregory Dunn
            while he was still in high school. His lyrical inspiration was the
            death of his friend. The track titled "8105" represents the date
            August 1, 2005 when the band was officially formed by both Gregory
            Dunn and Nicholas Pizzolato.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p><strong><em>Waves (2010-present)</em></strong></p>

            <p>Waves is Moving Mountains' second full-length album. Drifting
            from the sounds of Pneuma and Foreword, Moving Mountains wanted to
            create an album that would reflect how they play live.[3] Waves was
            also released on Triple Crown Records, the bands new label. Moving
            Mountains has stated that Triple Crown Records let them record and
            write the album however they wanted to. The lyrics were written by
            Gregory Dunn, some of which, like Pneuma, were again written about
            his friend that had died. He has stated that this is the last album
            with lyrics about his deceased friend.</p>

            <p>On February 7 they announced that they will be releasing a new
            EP entitled 'New Light', which is acoustic re-interpretations of
            two songs off Pneuma and two songs off Waves. The EP was released
            on April 24.</p>

            <p>On July 9, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that they have
            started writing and demoing their next full length album.</p>
