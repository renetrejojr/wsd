       	<p> An excerpt from their Myspace.com profile explains how they approach their musical endeavors: "For some bands, there is a core vision and purpose that shines through from beginning to the end. For others, there is an evolution of an idea, a constant metamorphosis whose end and scope is unknown. For Moving Mountains, the evolution not only encapsulates their music, but a larger overarching concept of what defines ‘Moving Mountains’. That isn’t to say that the Purchase, NY quartet have an artier than thou complex, but it does touch on an evolving aesthetic undercurrent and a belief that a band can create an experiential vision that goes beyond music."</p>
<p>Their musical style is reminiscent of The Appleseed Cast.</p>
<p>Their influences include Hammock and The Album Leaf.</p>
<p>Moving Mountains tracks <em>“Aphelion,” “Fourth,”</em> and <em>“8105”</em> have been used on MTV’s College Life, 16 and Pregnant, and Teen Mom.<p>
<p><em>“Aphelion”</em> has been used for a trailer for AMC’s television drama series Mad Men.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Formation and Pneuma (2005-2009)</em></strong></p>
<p>Their self-released album, Pneuma, was written by Gregory Dunn while he was still in high school. His lyrical inspiration was the death of his friend. The track titled "8105" represents the date August 1, 2005 when the band was officially formed by both Gregory Dunn and Nicholas Pizzolato.</p>
<p><strong><em>Waves (2010-present)</em></strong></p>
<p>Waves is Moving Mountains' second full-length album. Drifting from the sounds of Pneuma and Foreword, Moving Mountains wanted to create an album that would reflect how they play live.[3] Waves was also released on Triple Crown Records, the bands new label. Moving Mountains has stated that Triple Crown Records let them record and write the album however they wanted to. The lyrics were written by Gregory Dunn, some of which, like Pneuma, were again written about his friend that had died. He has stated that this is the last album with lyrics about his deceased friend.
<p>On February 7 they announced that they will be releasing a new EP entitled 'New Light', which is acoustic re-interpretations of two songs off Pneuma and two songs off Waves. The EP was released on April 24.</p>
<p>On July 9, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that they have started writing and demoing their next full length album.</p>
